# Question
Why would you want to use a `\b` character class instead of a `\s` character class?

# Answer
`\b`: specifies word boundary, which is a zero-width assertion indicating the position between a word character (\w) and a non-word character 
`\s`: Matches any whitespace character, including spaces, tabs, and line breaks.
